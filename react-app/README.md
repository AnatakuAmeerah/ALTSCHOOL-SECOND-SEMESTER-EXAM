This project was created using VITE+REACT and React router.

I created the folder using vite and deleted the unnecessary codes that came with the package.

I then created a Welcome component that contains my heading that spans across all pages.

After that i created a component folder that contained my pages that i will route between. 

I followed the react roucter documentation and used the createBrowserRouter because the documentation recommends it for all React router web projects. 

During the rendering of my RepoList component a key error is being thrown in the console but my useParams hook returns an object that contains the id of each child from the parent URL.
